# What is Statistics?

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves methods for gathering information, summarizing it, and drawing conclusions from it. Statistics helps in making informed decisions based on data and understanding patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets.

## Types of Statistics

There are two main types of statistics:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: This type involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and graphical representations such as histograms, bar charts, and pie charts. Descriptive statistics help to simplify large amounts of data into understandable summaries.

2. **Inferential Statistics**: This type involves making inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory to draw conclusions and includes techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Inferential statistics allow us to make predictions or test hypotheses about larger groups from smaller samples.
